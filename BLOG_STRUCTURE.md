# Blog Post Structure: "Digging DNS Data Exfiltration Detection and Protection using AWS"

## 1. Introduction to DNS Data Exfiltration
- What is DNS exfiltration and why attackers use it
- Why DNS is an ideal covert channel (ubiquitous, rarely monitored)
- Impact on organizations and data breach scenarios

## 2. DNS Exfiltration Techniques and Tools
- **Custom Implementation:** Your client.py/server.py tool for arbitrary file transfer over DNS
- **dnscat2:** Advanced DNS tunneling with encryption and session management
- **iodine:** IP-over-DNS tunneling for network bypass
- Common encoding methods and data chunking strategies
- Legitimate vs. malicious DNS traffic characteristics

## 3. Understanding DNS Exfiltration Patterns
- High-frequency query detection
- Data encoding in subdomain patterns
- Subdomain enumeration techniques
- Traffic volume and timing analysis

## 4. AWS-Based Detection Architecture
- Route 53 Resolver query logging
- S3-based log storage and partitioning
- Amazon Athena for real-time analysis
- AWS Glue for schema management and Public Suffix List integration

## 5. Detection Metrics and Analytics
- Query frequency thresholds and time windows
- Entropy analysis for encoded data detection
- Domain reputation and threat intelligence integration
- False positive reduction techniques

## 6. Hands-On Demo: Real-Time DNS Exfiltration Detection
- **Architecture Overview** (using integration architecture diagram)
- **Step-by-Step Implementation:**
  - High-frequency script setup and data generation
  - CloudWatch scheduled threat detection (1-minute window)
  - Athena saved queries analyzing 5-minute detection windows
  - Real-time detection and automated handling logic
  - DNS Firewall rule creation and deployment
- **Testing the Protection:**
  - Code snippets from TESTING.md for validation
  - Re-running data generation script post-protection
  - Demonstrating blocked requests (custom server never hit)
  - 2-minute end-to-end protection timeline
- **GuardDuty Limitations:**
  - Why GuardDuty didn't generate findings out-of-the-box
  - Custom script requirements for enhanced detection
